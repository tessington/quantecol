#' @details Example R code to accompany worked examples and figures shown in Introduction to Quantitative Ecology. This includes all of the datasets used, and many of the functions are named based on the figure number within the book text.  You may find it useful to view the code within the functions; all of the functions have an optional input argument "viewcode", that when set to "TRUE", will print out the code used in the function.
#' \itemize{
#' \item If the figures look strange, or if you get an error that says the figure margins are too small, simply drag the Rstudio panes so that the "Plot" window is larger.
#' \item Most of the functions are named according to the figure number in the text.  A small number of functions applied to multiple figures, or to an example within the text, so a more descriptive name was given in those cases.
